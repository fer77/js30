    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Louise';
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log(players, team);
    // team is a reference not a copy of the players array. Updating team will update the original array.
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // slice makes a copy and not a reference to the original array.

    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
